# Daily Problems - 100 Hrs ðŸš€

Welcome to my daily problem-solving journey as I embark on a quest to complete 100 Hrs of coding problems daily! ðŸŽ‰ Every day, I dedicate 1 hour to solving coding problems, and I'll be sharing my progress and learning here.

|      | 21. [sales_by_match.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/6hr/21.%20sales_by_match.py)  | I used the `//` operator for the first time. Pretty nice. |
|      | 22. [drawing_book.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/6hr/22.%20drawing_book.py)  |                                                         |
| 7hr  | 23. [counting_valleys.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/7hr/23.%20counting_valleys.py)  | Interesting Problem. Had fun solving it. |
|      | 24. [electronics_shop.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/7hr/24.%20electronics_shop.py)  |                                                         |
|      | 25. [cats_and_a_mouse.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/7hr/25.%20cats_and_a_mouse.py)  |                                                         |
| 8hr  | 26. [forming_a_magic_square.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/8hr/26.%20forming_a_magic_square.py)  | This is not a complete solution. The complete solution is in the next day. I was successful in making every number in the square identical by replacing the duplicates with the missing numbers. But in order to make the square a magic square, every column, row, and diagonal needs to add up to the magic number and then calculate the minimal cost. I looked at the forum. Out of all the problems, I find the solution to this problem to be the biggest cop out. I mean seriously??? Having predefined set of magic squares and then calculating the minimal cost from that. I expected a better solution. |
| 9hr  | 26. [forming_a_magic_square.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/9hr/26.%20forming_a_magic_square.py)  | Continued the problem from the previous day. |
| 10hr | 27. [picking_numbers.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/10hr/27.%20picking_numbers.py)  | It will give the correct result. The logic is correct. However, the time complexity is through the roof (2 ^ n). Gonna look at the forum for the correct approach tomorrow. |
| 11hr | 27. [picking_numbers.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/11hr/27.%20picking_numbers.py)  | I'm honestly speechless how good of a solution this is compared to my previous solution where I solved the problem through recursion. Thanks to the forum for inspiration. |
| 12hr | 28. [climbing_the_leaderboard.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/12hr/28.%20climbing_the_leaderboard.py)  | The code for now is returning the final ranked list. But, I haven't added the logic of finding the rankings from this list. Gonna continue the problem tomorrow. |
| 13hr | 28. [climbing_the_leaderboard.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/13hr/28.%20climbing_the_leaderboard.py)  | This code isn't passing all the test cases due to time being exceeded. |
| 14hr | 28. [climbing_the_leaderboard.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/14hr/28.%20climbing_the_leaderboard.py)  | Since my code wasn't passing some test cases due to time complexity, I took inspiration from a solution I found on Hackerrank forum. The problem is I'm not reading the given statement properly and not thinking outside the box. |
| 15hr | 29. [the_hurdle_race.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/15hr/29.%20the_hurdle_race.py)  |                                                         |
|      | 30. [designer_pdf_viewer.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/15hr/30.%20designer_pdf_viewer.py)  | I used the `ord` function to convert the character to its ASCII value, which was pretty nice. |
|      | 31. [utopian_tree.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/15hr/31.%20utopian_tree.py)  | Understood that the `range` function's ending point is exclusive. |
|      | 32. [angry_professor.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/15hr/32.%20angry_professor.py)  | Honestly, it was a good and tricky problem. Understanding the problem was important. |
|      | 33. [beautiful-days_at_the_movies.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/15hr/33.%20beautiful-days_at_the_movies.py)  | The `join` function was very useful. But, I looked at the forum and found that the number can be reversed very efficiently using slicing, such as `int(str(num)[::-1])` where the first colon means to include all the elements and `-1` means to traverse the string in reverse order. |
| 16hr | 34. [viral_advertising.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/16hr/34.%20viral_advertising.py)  |  |
|  | 35. [save_the_prisoner.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/16hr/35.%20save_the_prisoner.py)  | The problem is solved but not all the test cases are being passed due to time complexity.  |
| 17hr | 35. [save_the_prisoner.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/17hr/35.%20save_the_prisoner.py)  | I was using a loop in the previous solution. I thought of a better solution without the need for a loop which solved the problem. |
| 18hr | 36. [circular_array_rotation.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/18hr/36.%20circular_array_rotation.py)  | Pretty good problem. Rotating the array without any loop was pretty challenging. |
| 19hr | 37. [sequence_equation.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/19hr/37.%20sequence_equation.py)  |  |
|  | 38. [jumping_on_the_clouds.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/19hr/38.%20jumping_on_the_clouds.py)  |  |
| 20hr | 39. [find_digits.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/20hr/39.%20find_digits.py)  | Using a lamba function was really interesting to iterate over a number ```number = [int(char) for char in str(n)]``` . Another thing you gotta be mindful about is ZeroDivisionError, the error you get when dividing 0 or taking a modulus. |
|  | 40. [extra_long_factorials.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/20hr/40.%20extra_long_factorials.py)  | This problem is mainly designed for C++, C, etc. There is no issue at all in dealing with big numbers in Python.  | 
|  | 41. [append_and_delete.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/20hr/41.%20append_and_delete.py)  | The description of this problem was so bad. I'm really not proud of what I wrote and I think there might be a loophole in my code but it is what it is, it is 5 in the morning and I haven't slept. | 
| 21hr | 42. [sherlock_and_squares.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/21hr/42.%20sherlock_and_squares.py)  | Such an interesting problem. In my first try, I learnt how to check if a number has decimal points or not... ```if num == math.ceil(num)``` just mentioning this here. My first try wasn't passing all the test cases due to time complexity. Then, I found how you could calculate how many squares there are within a range mathematically. It was a good experience doing this problem. One of my favorite problems I solved here. | 
|  | 43. [library_fine.py](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/21hr/43.%20library_fine.py)  | My takeaway for this problem was I got to learn how to breakdown a problem in chunks to solve it as a whole. |
