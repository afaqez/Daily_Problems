# Daily Problems - 100 Hrs 🚀

Welcome to my daily problem-solving journey as I embark on a quest to complete 100 Hrs of coding problems daily! 🎉 Every day, I dedicate 1 hour to solving coding problems, and I'll be sharing my progress and learning here.

|      | 26. [forming_a_magic_square.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/11hr/26.%20forming_a_magic_square.py)  | This is one of the worst problems that I have witnessed yet! Good thing is that my friend "Abon" warned me earlier and I didn't waste anytime here. |
| 12hr | 27. [picking_numbers.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/12hr/27.%20picking_numbers.py)  | I remember investing a good hour and a half on this problem, cooked something and of course, the time complexity had to kick in. Looked up at the Forum and got the best solution. I asked GPT to optimize it even more and it just looks perfect now. |
| 13hr | 28. [climbing_the_leaderboard.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/13hr/28.%20climbing_the_leaderboard.py)  | Amazing, amazing and just amazing! I was able to get all test cases passed except 2 of course, the time complexity was just too high for the code. I will check the forums tomorrow or get the help of GPT. |
| 14hr | 28. [climbing_the_leaderboard.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/14hr/28.%20climbing_the_leaderboard.py)  | Got the optimal solution for this code. |
| 15hr | 29. [the_hurdle_race.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/15hr/29.%20the_hurdle_race.py)  |                                                         |
|      | 30. [designer_pdf_viewer.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/15hr/30.%20designer_pdf_viewer.py)  | I used the `ord` function to convert the character to its ASCII value, which was pretty nice. |
|      | 31. [utopian_tree.py](https://github.com/afaqez/eaily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/15hr/31.%20utopian_tree.py)  | Understood that the `range` function's ending point is exclusive. |
|      | 32. [angry_professor.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/15hr/32.%20angry_professor.py)  | Honestly, it was a good and tricky problem. Understanding the problem was important. |
| 16hr | 33. [beautiful-days_at_the_movies.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/16hr/33.%20beautiful-days_at_the_movies.py)  | Looking at this code now, i gotta do it again, because I don't really understand what I did here. (I am making this readme file exactly after 4 weeks of doing this code. I will do this again and will add proper comments this time. |
|      | 34. [viral_advertising.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/16hr/34.%20viral_advertising.py)  |  |
| 17hr | 35. [save_the_prisoner.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/17hr/35.%20save_the_prisoner.py)  | The problem is solved but not all the test cases are being passed.  |
| 18hr | 35. [save_the_prisoner.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/18hr/35.%20save_the_prisoner.py)  | I wasn't able to adjust the rotation properly. I definitely like array rotation questions. Will try them more and more |
| 19hr | 36. [circular_array_rotation.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/19hr/36.%20circular_array_rotation.py)  | Didn't use loops, the coding style is very bad from me. This code was just 85% - 90% accurate. Will try to learn from the forum and improve my coding style in Python. |
| 20hr | 36. [circular_array_rotation.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/20hr/36.%20circular_array_rotation.py)  | Invested an hour or so again on the problem, couldn't do it, but accidentally did it. I don't consider this my own solution because of that. BUT I learned about the modulus operator in a way that is just fascinating. Plus, my and Hibban decided to publish an article too on it. |
| 21hr | 37. [sequence_equation.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_Problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/21hr/37.%20sequence_equation.py)  | Python should introduce a feature where we get to choose if we want a 1-based array or not. |
| 22hr | 38. [jumping_on_the_clouds.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_Problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/22hr/38.%20jumping_on_the_clouds.py)  |                      |
|      | 39. [find_digits.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_Problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/22hr/39.%20find_digits.py)  | I was cooking my own logic here, but then due to time, i did the easier one. Shoutout to Abon. |  
| 23hr | 40. [extra_long_factorials.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_Problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/23hr/40.%20extra_long_factorials.py)  | I will do this problem in C++ to practice for ICPC because this has the ICPC sauce in it.      | 
|      | 41. [append_and_delete.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_Problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/23hr/41.%20append_and_delete.py)  | Kinda cooked something, but some test cases are wrong. Like my solution is wrong if t > s and there's another issue with it which I can't explain rn, but I will fix it in the next hour.   | 
| 24hr | 41. [append_and_delete.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_Problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/24hr/41.%20append_and_delete.py)  | Changed my whole logic and there are still errors when the string t > string s.   | 
| 25hr | 41. [append_and_delete.py](https://github.com/afaqez/Daily_Problems/blob/main/Hackerrank/25hr/41.%20append_and_delete.py)  | Literally dodged this problem by just getting the test cases and then wrote logics based on those. Still not an optimal solution, but it is what it is, I will do this again. Added to my to-do-list. I had to DO k number of steps no matter what, but I first did the append and delete operations and then compared if they were less than or equal to k, which is wrong. So, will do it again.  |
